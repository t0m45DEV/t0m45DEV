## Hello there :D

My name is Tomas Lisazo, a young Computer Science student at UBA.

I like developing video games in my free time, apart from coding different programs to learn and getting to know different tools. You can find more of my programming projects in my account.

## ðŸŽ® Published games:

- [Spinning Ball](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=t0m45DEV.SpinningBall)
- [The Top](https://cachimba-games.itch.io/the-top)
- [Santa's drunk](https://cachimba-games.itch.io/santas-drunk)
- [Through the Asteroid Belt](https://t0m45dev.itch.io/asteroidsbelt)

I am currently working on a 3D video game engine that, hopefully, will be published before 2025 âš¡

The updates for that project can be seen in this [repo](https://github.com/t0m45DEV/3D-Game-in-C).
