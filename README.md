## Hello there :D

My name is Tomas Lisazo, a young Computer Science student at UBA.

I like to develop video games in my free time, apart from programming different programs to learn and get to know different tools. The different programming projects that I design are published in this account.

## 🎮 Published games:

- [Spinning Ball](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=t0m45DEV.SpinningBall)
- [The Top](https://cachimba-games.itch.io/the-top)
- [Santa's drunk](https://cachimba-games.itch.io/santas-drunk)
- [Through the Asteroid Belt](https://t0m45dev.itch.io/asteroidsbelt)

I am currently working on a 3D video game engine that, hopefully, will be published before 2025 ⚡

The updates for that project can be seen in this [repo](https://github.com/t0m45DEV/3D-Game-in-C).
